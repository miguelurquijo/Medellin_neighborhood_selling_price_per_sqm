# Medellin_neighborhood_selling_price_per_sqm
<p>The goal of this scrip is to compare the average sqm price of each neighborhood in Medellin</p>
<p>I did some web scrapping using BeautifulSoup, data manipulation with Pandas and Numpy and some cool data visualization with Folium to create a map of Medelllin comparing the price per square meter in each neighborhood</P>
